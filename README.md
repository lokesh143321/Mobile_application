# Mobile_application
Created an Mobile application using java-script, react-native and Figma for designing.

My PMDb was the name of the application that we developed as team for my first Project of Movie Database. The main aim of this App is to provide more information
about the movies and also provide a lot new movies to the User.Furthermore, this app can be used by a large number of users who are unaware of a new movie and can use it because
it is so quick and easy to use by any user. And, in order to use this app, you must first open our mobile application, and the user must create an account with an email address
and a password.
